## Unit - 1: HTML, CSS, and Git

At the heart of every website is **HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**. As the standard language used to build the structure of a webpage, HTML allows us to define elements like paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

**Cascading Style Sheets**, or **CSS**, is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. CSS determines how elements are presented on the page, including font, color, size, positioning of elements, and even animation.
